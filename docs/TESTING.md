# Developer checks and verification limits

Tests use synthetic wardrobes and temporary data folders. Never run destructive checks against a personal wardrobe. Passing tests is evidence for the covered behavior, not proof that the app is defect-free or that every platform works.

## Run the automated checks

With Node/npm and Python available:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs JavaScript checks plus Python storage, import, sample, and HTTP-handler tests. The default app needs no npm installation. Photo-import tests require Pillow; install `runtime/requirements-import.txt` into your chosen Python environment and run the tests with that environment active. Some optional photo checks skip when dependencies are unavailable; inspect the test output.

For focused changes, run the relevant existing test rather than repeating every suite. Use the full suite for storage, import/export, cross-cutting behavior, or release checkpoints.

Coverage includes:

- Navigation, preference persistence, filters, collections, board/outfit isolation, layering, and packing behavior.
- Bookmarks, Back/Forward, and guards for unsaved piece, collection, outfit, and trip edits.
- Import validation, duplicate handling, image metadata, retry/idempotency, and transactional failure behavior.
- Storage persistence, full backup/restore, missing-photo rejection, recovery snapshots, and rollback.
- Unsafe text/URLs, poisoned JSON keys, malformed archives and image headers, request tokens, origin/Host checks, and CSP generation.
- The 12-piece sample’s taxonomy, photos, export/restore, and refusal to replace a nonempty wardrobe.

HTTP-handler tests use in-memory connections. They do not replace a listening-server test. JavaScript VM tests do not verify native dialogs, focus behavior, rendering, or mobile keyboards.

## Browser and device checks

The optional smoke suite needs Playwright and a browser installation:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

`tests/smoke.js` checks the code-only app at desktop and phone widths. It is a smoke check, not complete coverage of writable storage or the user journey. Use a separate synthetic sample for manual checks with the live server.

Before release, verify:

- All three themes at desktop and narrow phone widths, including text-only labels, large text, focus visibility, modal scrolling, and keyboard clearance.
- Creating and editing pieces, galleries, swatches, optional cutouts, and bulk photo review.
- The working board versus saved outfits, including drag/resize controls and reachable handles for tall pieces.
- Collections, long lists, filters, and returning from a piece with scroll position restored.
- Trip creation, packing generation, unavailable pieces, pinned outfits, rebuilding, saving, and reopening.
- Calendar month links, bookmarked pieces/outfits/collections/trips, and Back/Forward with unsaved edits. Cancelling a discard must preserve the view, address, and edits.
- Full backup and restore with photos, plus recovery from a failed save.
- Real Android/iOS keyboards, assistive technology, and the supported installation platforms.

Keep browser reviews bounded and use synthetic data. This project’s development workflow requires the owner’s approval before browser automation.

## Keeping embedded sources synchronized

The served HTML contains embedded copies of several maintained source files. After editing one, run its sync tool:

- `app/styles/themes.css`: `python3 tools/sync_theme_styles.py`
- `app/scripts/setup.js`: `python3 tools/sync_setup.py`
- Collections and navigation modules: use the corresponding `tools/sync_*.py` helper.
- Import categories and tag vocabulary: `node tools/sync_import_vocab.js`

The existing tests check relevant synchronization and source invariants.

## 0.1 candidate verification

The release branch excludes Sky. The development build and dev site retain it; checks of those builds do not establish that Sky is part of 0.1.

Completed on the candidate:

- GitHub Actions passed the full JavaScript suite, 53 Python tests, dependency advisory checks, public-source checks, and full-history Gitleaks scanning. Actions are pinned to commit revisions.
- A separate Python 3.10 CI job passed core runtime tests and sample initialization, startup preparation, and backup export without optional packages. The full suite also runs on Python 3.12.
- On Linux with Python 3.14, a freshly extracted ZIP started a listening server without site packages. Its manifest matched its files, and its source contained no embedded wardrobe or Sky modules.
- A browser downloaded a full sample backup containing 12 photos, a saved outfit, and a working board. Cancelling restore preserved a sample edit. Confirming restore reproduced the backed-up catalog, collections, and board exactly; the automatic recovery snapshot retained the replaced edit. Updated extracted source reopened the same data successfully. This checks source replacement, not a general future-version migration or downgrade guarantee.
- Browse-title padding and theme typography were checked at 390 × 844 and 1300 × 900 across all three themes in light and dark. Lab accessory labels, shoe preservation while accessorizing, and positive-first My Taste ordering were checked with synthetic data.
- A read-only performance pass used an existing 1,100-piece wardrobe at 390 × 844 in desktop Chrome. Search, category filtering, scrolling, and board-tray search responded without a visible stall. Browse mounted 60 cards plus its loading sentinel rather than the whole wardrobe. This was a bounded observation, not a hardware benchmark or physical-phone test; long board-tray and Lab lists remain future optimization work.
- The optional photo worker uses direct U²-Net/ONNX inference and Pillow 13 or newer. A synthetic setup rehearsal and inference check passed previously, and the mask matched the former implementation without changing RGB pixels. The latest dependency advisory checks passed; a fresh optional-tool installation was not repeated during the final recovery pass.

The passing source/security and minimum-Python jobs are recorded in [this CI run](https://github.com/stephthegeek/closetlint/actions/runs/39668276536). Changes after that commit need their relevant checks.

Still open before tagging: Stephanie’s final physical-mobile workflow pass and resolution of any blockers it finds. Windows and macOS installation, broad assistive-technology coverage, and an independent human security audit have not been completed. State these limits in release notes rather than implying every platform or workflow has been certified.
